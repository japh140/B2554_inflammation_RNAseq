### [Kotlyarov & Kotlyarova, 2022] ‚Äì *Molecular Pharmacology of Inflammation Resolution in Atherosclerosis*

**Study Type**: Narrative Review  

**Focus**:  
- Discusses unresolved inflammation in atherosclerosis due to imbalance between pro-inflammatory mediators and specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs).
- Introduces the concept of "resolution pharmacology" and SPM-based therapeutic strategies.

**Key Genes/Enzymes**:  
- **ALOX5** ‚Äì produces leukotrienes and lipoxins depending on subcellular localization.  
- **ALOX15** ‚Äì generates lipoxins, resolvins, protectins from omega-3 PUFAs.  
- **PTGS2 (COX-2)** ‚Äì acetylated by aspirin to produce 15-epi-lipoxins.  
- **ALOX5AP (FLAP)** ‚Äì activates ALOX5, linked to coronary artery disease.  
- **CYP450** ‚Äì involved in generating SPMs (e.g., epoxyeicosatrienoic acids).  
- **ABCA1, ABCB11** ‚Äì downstream genes regulated by lipoxins, affecting cholesterol transport.

**Receptors**:  
- **FPR2 (ALX)** ‚Äì binds lipoxins and resolvins; modulates inflammation.  
- **CMKLR1 (ChemR23)** ‚Äì receptor for RvE1.  
- **GPR32** ‚Äì receptor for RvD1.  
- **AhR, CysLT1R** ‚Äì involved in lipoxin signaling and pro-inflammatory pathways.

**SPMs Discussed**:  
- **Lipoxins (LXA4, 15-epi-LXA4)**  
- **Resolvins (RvD1, RvD2, RvE1)**  
- **Protectins (PD1, PDX)**  
- **Maresins (MaR1, MaR2)**  

**Takeaway**:  
- Resolution failure in atherosclerosis is driven by low SPM levels and dysregulated expression of resolution-related genes (ALOX5, ALOX15, FPR2, etc.).  
- SPMs like LXA4 and RvD1 are reduced in unstable plaques.  
- Enhancing resolution via SPM analogues or aspirin-triggered lipoxins offers therapeutic potential.  
- These genes and receptors are **ideal targets** for differential expression analysis in transcriptomic datasets.

### [Tanwar et al., 2023] ‚Äì *Palmitic Acid‚ÄìInduced lncRNA PARAIL Regulates Inflammation via ELAVL1 in Monocytes and Macrophages*

**Study Type**: RNA-seq analysis + functional studies (knockdown, RIP, RNA-pulldown)

**Focus**:  
- Identifies **PARAIL**, a novel lncRNA upregulated by **palmitic acid (PA)** in monocytes/macrophages.  
- Demonstrates PARAIL‚Äôs anti-inflammatory and **pro-resolution** role via interaction with **ELAVL1**, an RNA-binding protein.

**Key Genes/lncRNAs**:  
- **PARAIL (lncRNA)** ‚Äì inhibits pro-inflammatory genes by retaining ELAVL1 in the nucleus.  
- **ELAVL1 (HuR)** ‚Äì binds AU-rich elements (AREs) in inflammatory mRNAs (e.g., IL1B, PTGS2); stabilized in the cytosol when PARAIL is low.  
- **RIPK2** ‚Äì adjacent to PARAIL; upregulated by PA but unaffected by PARAIL knockdown.

**Inflammatory Genes Regulated**:  
- **IL1B, IL6, TNF, PTGS2, THBS1** ‚Äì all elevated when PARAIL is knocked down.  
- Expression of these genes remained high during late-phase inflammation (48h), showing impaired resolution.

**Mechanism**:  
- PARAIL binds ELAVL1 via ARE motifs ‚Üí prevents ELAVL1 from stabilizing inflammatory mRNAs in cytoplasm.  
- In chronic inflammation (e.g., diabetes, atherosclerosis), **PARAIL is downregulated**, allowing cytosolic ELAVL1 accumulation and sustained inflammation.

**SPM Relevance**:  
- While no specific SPMs are tested, **PARAIL is functionally pro-resolving**, promoting inflammation resolution through transcript stability control.  
- Complements the lipid-mediated resolution seen in SPM studies (e.g., LXA4, RvD1) by showing **non-lipid resolution regulation via lncRNA‚Äìprotein interactions**.

**Takeaway**:  
- **PARAIL‚ÄìELAVL1 axis** is a new resolution mechanism: transcriptional + post-transcriptional regulation of inflammation.  
- **PARAIL and ELAVL1** are now candidate resolution regulators for expression tracking in cardiometabolic RNA-seq datasets.

**Study Type**: Review  
**Focus**: Comprehensive overview of LOX, COX, CYP, and AKR enzymology in biosynthesis of oxylipins, including SPMs.  
**Relevance**: Highlights enzymes involved in SPM biosynthesis (ALOX5, ALOX15, COX-2, CYPs) and contextualizes gene-level regulation relevant to inflammation and resolution in humans.

**Key Points**:
- **ALOX5, ALOX15, ALOX12, PTGS2, ALOX5AP, CYP4F2, AKR1B1**, etc. are central to the production and regulation of SPMs (e.g., LXA4, RvD1).
- Describes structural/functional characteristics of resolution enzymes in humans.
- Discusses regulation of enzymatic activity, dimerization, cellular localization, and reaction specificity (e.g., EPA/DHA preference).
- Links **substrate promiscuity** to challenges in tracking lipid pathways.
- Suggests integration of PUFA- and cholesterol-derived oxidized lipids in disease mechanisms like atherosclerosis.

**Takeaway**: Offers foundational enzymatic context for SPM and oxylipin biosynthesis ‚Äì a critical reference for interpreting gene expression data and designing RNA-seq resolution pipelines.

**Keywords**: ALOX5, ALOX15, PTGS2, CYP4F2, LOX, COX, CYP450, SPM, LXA4, RvD1, atherosclerosis, inflammation resolution
