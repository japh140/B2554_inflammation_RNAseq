# Project Scope – Atherosclerosis Focus

## Disease Focus  
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular condition characterized by the accumulation of plaques in arterial walls. The disease involves both innate and adaptive immune responses, and resolution mechanisms are often impaired in chronic cases.

## Research Objective  
To investigate dysregulated resolution mechanisms in atherosclerosis using publicly available bulk RNA-seq datasets. The analysis will focus on:
- Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs)  
- Anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β)  
- Lipoxygenases (e.g., ALOX5, ALOX15)  
- Cyclooxygenases (e.g., COX-2 / PTGS2)  
- GPCRs involved in resolution signaling (e.g., ALX/FPR2, ChemR23)  

## Data Focus  
- Dataset type: Bulk RNA-seq (atherosclerotic plaque vs. healthy artery tissue)  
- Tissue types: Carotid or coronary artery plaques  
- Source: Public repositories (e.g., GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress)  
- Sample comparison: Diseased vs. healthy arteries (potential covariates include age, sex, and ethnicity if metadata is available)  

## Link to Project Goals  
This direction aligns with the B2554 project brief to investigate dysregulated inflammatory resolution mechanisms using transcriptomic data.

## Optional Extensions  
If time and data permit, additional datasets may be used to:
- Compare gene expression patterns in other inflammation-related cardiovascular conditions (e.g., post-myocardial infarction tissue)  
- Integrate machine learning models to classify samples and identify high-impact resolution-related gene signatures
