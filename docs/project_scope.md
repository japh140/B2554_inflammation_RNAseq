# Project Scope – Osteoarthritis Focus

## Disease Focus
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease, commonly triggered or worsened by mechanical stress or injury. It is highly relevant to my interests as a physically active Black African male, due to its prevalence in athletes and evidence of greater severity in Black populations.

## Research Objective
To investigate dysregulated resolution mechanisms in OA using publicly available bulk RNA-seq datasets. The analysis will focus on identifying altered expression in genes involved in resolution pathways, including:
- Specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs)
- Anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β)
- Lipoxygenases (e.g., ALOX5, ALOX15)
- Cyclooxygenases (e.g., COX-2 / PTGS2)
- GPCRs for resolution signaling (e.g., ALX/FPR2, GPR32)

## Data Focus
- Dataset type: Bulk RNA-seq (OA vs. healthy)
- Tissue types: Cartilage and/or synovium
- Source: GEO or similar public repositories
- Sample comparison: Disease vs. control (and possibly age/sex/ethnicity metadata if available)

## Link to Project Goals
This focus aligns directly with the B2554 project brief to investigate dysregulated resolution in inflammatory diseases using RNA-seq. OA represents a biologically and socially relevant model where failure of inflammation resolution plays a central role.

## Optional Extensions
If time and data permit, a secondary comparative analysis may be performed using a dataset from atherosclerosis or sickle cell disease, to explore shared or disease-specific patterns in resolution failure.
