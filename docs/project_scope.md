# Project Scope – Atherosclerosis Focus

## Disease Focus
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular condition characterized by the accumulation of plaques in arterial walls. These plaques form through persistent low-grade inflammation and the failure of resolution pathways to clear lipids, immune cells, and tissue damage. Emerging evidence highlights the importance of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in controlling vascular inflammation and promoting tissue repair. Dysregulation of SPM signaling may contribute to plaque instability and progression toward heart attack or stroke.

## Research Objective
To investigate dysregulated resolution mechanisms in atherosclerosis using publicly available bulk RNA-seq datasets. The analysis will focus on identifying differential expression of genes involved in:
- Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs)
- Anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β)
- Lipoxygenases (e.g., ALOX5, ALOX15)
- Cyclooxygenases (e.g., COX-2 / PTGS2)
- GPCRs involved in resolution signaling (e.g., ALX/FPR2, ChemR23)

## Data Focus
- Dataset type: Bulk RNA-seq (atherosclerotic plaque vs. healthy artery tissue)
- Tissue types: Carotid or coronary artery plaques
- Source: Public repositories (e.g., GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress)
- Sample comparison: Diseased vs. healthy arteries (potential covariates include age, sex, and ethnicity if metadata is available)

## Link to Project Goals
This direction aligns with the B2554 project brief to investigate dysregulated inflammatory resolution mechanisms using transcriptomic approaches. It applies differential gene expression and pathway analysis to cardiovascular disease—an inflammatory condition of high global relevance—and allows exploration of SPM-related resolution failure in atherosclerotic plaque development and instability.

## Optional Extensions
If time and data permit, additional datasets may be used to:
- Compare gene expression patterns in other inflammation-related cardiovascular conditions (e.g., post-myocardial infarction tissue)
- Integrate machine learning models to classify samples and identify high-impact resolution-related gene signatures
